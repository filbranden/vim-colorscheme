## filbranden's Vim colorschemes.

This is still work in progress.

I have a theme that I like (I call it "subtle") but it's probably not fully
ready for mass consumption yet...

I recently stumbled upon the ["Consistent terminal colors with 16-ANSI-color
Vim themes" article](https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/vim-16-color/) and I really
agree with those ideas, so I want to address that by making "subtle" also
available on popular terminals (gnome-terminal, Terminal, konsole, iTerm2.)
